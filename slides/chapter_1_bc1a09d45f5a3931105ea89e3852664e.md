## Why the SpeechRecognition library?

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "02f921a7a4"
center_content: false
```

`@part1`
Many Python based speech recognition libraries exist.

- apiai {{1}}
- assemblyai {{2}}
- google-cloud-speech {{3}}
- wit.ai {{4}}
- SpeechRecognition {{5}}

**SpeechRecognition** {{6}}

1. Low barrier to entry {{7}}
2. Compatibility with many other speech recognition APIs {{8}}


`@script`
Plenty of Speech Recognition packages exist but we’ll be using SpeechRecognition

Searching the internet for speech recognition python packages will yield a fair few results.

There’s:
* Apiai
* Assemblyai
* Google-cloud-speech
* Wit.ai
* SpeechRecognition

Many offer similar services when it comes to speech recognition, some with more robust features outside the scope of this course but none you won’t be prepared to dive into once you’ve finished.

For now, we’re going to be focusing on the SpeechRecogntion library. For both it’s low barrier to entry and it’s compatibility with many available speech recognition APIs you may want to look into later on.
